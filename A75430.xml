            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Authors of this Declaration are the ≈øame men; who having acted that execrable parricide upon the King a≈ø≈øumed the name of Parliament, which they had aboli≈øhed. Their beginning and growth hath beene formerly publi≈øhed, how a few lurking Sectaries being at fir≈øt Members of Parliament, and con≈øorting in prodigious opinions in Religion and policy with the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate rabble, became u≈øefull to the prime projectors, that under the maske of ≈øecuring Religion and Lawes, ≈øought to gaine the power of the State into their hands, being a≈ø≈øi≈øted in their votes in the Lower Hou≈øe, and applauded abroad for their proceedings by this bu≈øy crew, who got into places in the Army, and at la≈øt gave law to their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, and having renounced faith and obedience to their King, with more ea≈øe ≈øcorned the bonds of a≈ø≈øociation to their guides &amp; con≈øorts in the ≈øame impieties; And it cannot ≈øeem ≈øtrange to any that look on their Actions, to reade their ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe Declarations, nor that they ≈øhould proceede with like injury to ≈øtrangers, as they have u≈øed to their King, Companions and Countreymen.</p>
            <p>They ≈øay, <hi>the returns which the people of the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nited Provinces, made toward this Commonwealth will hardly be believed, if their ≈øufferings and deliverance, and the principles and spirit that acted in them then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and the help they had from this Nation with the expence of Engli≈øh blood and trea≈øure.</hi> The people of the≈øe Provinces have with gratitude acknowledged the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance they received from the Crown of England, and the affection and readines of the Engli≈øh Nation; And it were a ju≈øt reproach if they ≈øhould make returnes for tho≈øe benefits to the U≈øurpers of the regal power, de≈øtroyers of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and Oppre≈ø≈øors of this Nation. Can Nationall obligations be transferred to the Enemies of the Nation? And becau≈øe a Traiterous Army hath gotten power over the Nation, ≈øhall the Friends and Allies of the Nation a≈ø≈øi≈øt the U≈øurpers? This will hardly be believed, but ea≈øily that the≈øe Declarers have the impudence to pretend a right to all that which was due to the Crown that they have abjured.</p>
            <p>Though their boa≈øting of ≈øucce≈ø≈øes be a principle part in all their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and ≈øo in this, <hi>Yet it is not intended</hi> (they ≈øay) <hi>to be very particular in mentioning the State of the affairs of this Commonwealth, as it ≈øtood when, oppre≈ø≈øed by a Tyrant, they were nece≈ø≈øitated to fly to Armes, for defence of their Lives and E≈øtates, becau≈øe in Parliament they did but a≈ø≈øert, and de≈øire the ≈øetling of their ju≈øt and Native liberties.</hi> When over particulars are mentioned of the State of <pb n="3" facs="tcp:123920:2"/>affaires in England in the time of the late King, their Faithle≈ø≈øe and bloody proceedings mu≈øt more cleerly be manife≈øt. And its proofe to all rea≈øonable men of a re≈øolved continuance in wicked undertakings, that they call the King <hi>a Tyrant,</hi> when not onely the mildne≈ø≈øe of his nature, and Moderation of his privat and publique Actions, but the Peace and Pro≈øperity of the People was ≈øo univer≈øally knowne to ≈øtrangers, and when in all that peevi≈øh di≈øcontent, or Traiterous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could offer again≈øt him, there was no one Act in its nature and ≈øub≈øtance <hi>Oppre≈ø≈øion,</hi> but ≈øuch only, as were pretended might not be done by the King out of Parliament, and no one of the≈øe was done by the King, <hi>Regi√¢ manu, (with the Kingly power)</hi> but left to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mini≈øters of Law, and Ju≈øtice to decide in point of right, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute accordingly; but the≈øe men knowing how odious their Actions are, ≈øeeke a cover from reproachfull appellations upon the King, as if any could entertaine a prejudice by mi≈ønaming per≈øons, or Actions, and if it were <hi>Tyranny</hi> for the King to do an Action out of Parliament, which he was advi≈øed by the Judges of law he ju≈øtly might: how impudent are the≈øe men to reduce it? For where is the Parliament Authority for their va≈øt levies of mony, Murder of the King, and the impo≈øing Lawes upon the people? Can a few per≈øons of the Lower Hou≈øe, ≈øcarce the tenth part of the whole, by violence totally aboli≈øh both Hou≈øes, and doe all Acts that belonged to the whole? And yet they per≈øwade the world they are beleeved in ≈øuch extravagant untruths. There need nothing be more ≈øaid how cau≈øele≈øly the Rebells of <hi>England</hi> tooke Armes again≈øt the King. And if Rebells may pretend defence of their per≈øons again≈øt Soveraigne power, Malefactors will never want a ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when force is u≈øed to bring them to Ju≈øtice. And is it <hi>one of the ju≈øt and native liberties of the Engli≈øh nation,</hi> that the members of Parliament in the Lower Hou≈øe being five hundred, forty of the≈øe may drive out the re≈øt, and doe what they plea≈øe? this is the pre≈øent ca≈øe. But if we looke back, <hi>is it the liberty of England</hi> to be without a King, or to be ≈øubject to the power of one another, &amp; have no recour≈øe to their Prince for redre≈ø≈øe! <hi>Is it the liberty of England,</hi> that a rabble of the City of <hi>London</hi> or an Army ≈øhall oppre≈ø≈øe the Parliament and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound laws to oblige the whol Kingdom? <hi>Is it the liberty of England</hi> to exclude the King from making of laws, or governing the Militia? But they that are not a≈øhamed to act, yet ≈øeeme loath to ≈øpeak the things they doe. The ≈øeizing the Kings forts and navy, rai≈øing force again≈øt him and both Hou≈øes of Parliament, puni≈øhing Judges for doing their <pb n="4" facs="tcp:123920:3"/>duty, and delivering their opinions in open Courts, again≈øt ≈øedition, licencing all lewd ≈øectaries and di≈øturbers of Government are
<hi>only a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting and de≈øire of ≈øetling ju≈øt and native liberties.</hi> Thus they call their murders <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> their robberies <hi>Reparation of Wrongs;</hi> And their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution of the King from one end of the Kingdome to the other, <hi>the defence of their lives and E≈øtates.</hi> Its well ≈øeene, that tho≈øe men are the God of Gods anger upon the three Kingdoms, but they vainly flatter them≈øelvs to think that any beleeve it <hi>a ble≈ø≈øing of God</hi> as they a≈ø≈øume it, or <hi>that the≈øe wonders in ≈øo many ≈øignal battells, or that ≈øeries of providence was either in favour to them or their cau≈øe,</hi> and ≈øuch pre≈øumptuous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences declare of what ≈øpirit men are, that they take up the language of
<hi>Senacharib,</hi> who came not without God again≈øt <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and of the <hi>Turk,</hi> that attributes all his ≈øucce≈ø≈øes again≈øt the
<hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> to the power of his <hi>fal≈øe Prophet.</hi> And tho≈øe men that in their writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the King, u≈øed the name of the whole Kingdom on their part, and the ≈ømall ≈øtrength of the King, now tells us of
<hi>an handfull of men that were faithfull to the cau≈øe,</hi> even ≈øo
<hi>faithfull,</hi> that they fir≈øt brake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to their King, and then all fidelity to men. What they ≈øaid in this clau≈øe they ≈øay, <hi>was not intended to be mentioned,</hi> and indeed it no way concerned their pre≈øent controver≈øie with the United Provinces, unle≈ø≈øe they thought to ≈øcare all men by recounting their own Actions. But they proceed to ≈øay, <hi>neither is that indeavour to divide them in the memorable yeare of forty eight to be omitted.</hi> Surely the one might have been <hi>omitted</hi> as well as the other was <hi>not intended,</hi> for it hath nothing proper to their Declaration, unle≈ø≈øe they meant to make their owne ≈øtory; And they very un≈øea≈øonably mention <hi>the endeavour to divide them,</hi> when they were formerly divided, and the divi≈øion ≈øtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and them≈øelves not onely endeavoured, but effected it, rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now they come to <hi>unkindne≈ø≈øes</hi> received, <hi>that the Parliament ≈øent a Re≈øident to the States General, who refu≈øed to receive him.</hi> The rea≈øon is very apparent. The Parliament never had ≈øent any Re≈øident, neither was any ≈øuch Authority acknowledged by forreign States; And its a known Trea≈øon for the per≈øons in Parliament to doe ≈øuch an Act. Be≈øides the United Provinces were in league and amity with the King. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or ≈øuch, as called them≈øelves ≈øo, had not then renounced the Kingly Title, and ≈øtill allowed the Oaths of Allegeance, and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to the King, and therefore their Re≈øident was ill ≈øent, and ju≈øtly refu≈øed. But they think this amounts to an unkindne≈øs, <hi>≈øince it proceeded from their affection to the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nited Provinces, the e≈øtabli≈øhment of liberty &amp; advantage of traffique, and strength to both.</hi> Their affections are doubtles ≈øuch, as are u≈øuall between neer and potent Republiques, e≈øpecially where the advantages of traffique are the common aim of both, which not only creates emulations, but nece≈ø≈øarily makes continued diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences till one be de≈øtroyed; and thence proceeded the Judgement of Qu.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who concluded that the United Provinces mu≈øt in wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome de≈øire the ≈øtability of the Engli≈øh Monarchy, where by the≈øe rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be prevented, &amp; the Crown of England had greater a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the≈øe Provinces in the Government they were under, then if they had bin under a Prince, when new Alliances and engagements would continually change the affections and Councels of the Prince, but when the≈øe men ≈øent their Re≈øident, their affections were to their own intere≈øt, and they ≈øought to gain reputation by having a Re≈øident received, and to dimini≈øh the Kingly power abroad</p>
            <p>But <hi>the rea≈øon above al</hi> (they ≈øay) <hi>was the advancement of the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Religion, which both profe≈øs, and which in humane probability would receive the greate≈øt growth by their friend≈øhip.</hi> The State of the United Provinces did not think, that England profe≈ø≈øed not the true Prote≈øtant <pb n="7" facs="tcp:123920:4"/>Religion in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Kings ≈øince, but the Religion tho≈øe new Governours profe≈ø≈øe, no true Prote≈øtant will own for his, no one Church e≈øtabli≈øhed in any e≈øtate concurring with them; And as one chief Article in their Religion is upon their own private Authority <hi>to rob their neighbours and kill their Kings:</hi> ≈øo their doctrine and practice hath been a great ≈øcandall to the Prote≈øtant Religion, wherof they pretend to be. Their profe≈ø≈øed opinions are de≈øtructive to humane ≈øociety, di≈øclaiming all ≈øubjection to Civil Governors, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øticall Synods, further then their private opinions concur with them, and maintaine not onely the reproaches of Rulers, but violence again≈øt them, if in their judgement they de≈øerve puni≈øhment to death, and this tho≈øe men would have to be the true Prote≈øtant Religion, and their affection to the Prote≈øtant Religion is ≈øeene in their cruelty to the Prote≈øtants of England.</p>
            <p>Next they ob≈øerved <hi>in ≈øome of the Governors, and people of tho≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries an affection to this cau≈øe, and expre≈ø≈øed by them in their free contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the poore Prote≈øtants in Ireland.</hi> It is far from a probability, that any affected their cau≈øe, becau≈øe they contributed to the poore Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants of Ireland. Them≈øelves well know, that very many contributed to the poore Prote≈øtants of Ireland, that hated the Rebellion, that occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it; &amp; if any man hated the Iri≈øh Rebellion, he mu≈øt from the ≈øame grounds have dete≈øtation of a greater and more guilty, which followed in England; And the ≈øuffering Prote≈øtants in England are more in number, and for quality more eminent then tho≈øe in Ireland, and that of England hath had more barbarous effects, and is more incapable of excu≈øe, that of Ireland pretending difference of Nation and Religion, this of England pretending the ≈øame Religion, as they were of the ≈øame Nation; And its too well knowne both at home, &amp; abroad how many tho≈øe in England have robbed of their E≈øtates, that not only contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the reliefe of the poor Prote≈øtants of Ireland, but hazarded their lives in that cau≈øe. And ≈øuch, as in the beginning of the troubles in England extended compa≈ø≈øion to the poor Prote≈øtants of Ireland, di≈øcerned not the mercile≈ø≈øe di≈øpo≈øition of tho≈øe men, that then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned affaires in England, who never did one Act in order to their relief, but made u≈øe of their ≈øufferings to reproach the King; And by hypocriticall motions of other men to Charity ≈øought an opinion of Zeal to them≈øelves, and means to carry on the war in England again≈øt the King; And tho≈øe great ≈øummes, that were given to the reliefe of Ireland they converted to the maintenance of their own Rebellion in <pb n="8" facs="tcp:123920:5"/>England; and as many in the≈øe Provinces find the error they were in touching the integrity of the Reformers in England: So their Actions for the reliefe of the poor Prote≈øtents in Ireland will not prove, that they hated Rebellion le≈ø≈øe in tho≈øe, that profe≈ø≈øe the Prote≈øtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then the Popi≈øh.</p>

But <hi>Dori≈ølaus</hi> was killed in an hou≈øe ≈øuddenly, which, though in the place of re≈øidence of the States Generall, tho≈øe complainers cannot pretend it in the power of the States Generall to have prevented, and they cannot intend <hi>the breach of all Rules of intercour≈øe, or humanity</hi> in that Act by the States, though they di≈øplay the fact with ≈øuch colours. They need not be told, that <hi>the Rules of intercour≈øe, and humanity</hi> allow no protection to common rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and enemies of humane ≈øociety; And tho≈øe men, that think the world ≈øo ready to make the Judgement they like, of this fact upon <hi>Dori≈ølaus,</hi> ≈øee not the Judgement them≈øelves given of their own a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therein the Crime of <hi>Dori≈ølaus</hi> in the murder of the King: was not every man as much a Magi≈øtrate to execute <hi>Dori≈ølaus</hi> as they their King?

They well know the≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours were ≈øent to the King and though thye interceded with them, that called them≈øelves Parliament, it was in that manner as Emba≈ø≈øadours addre≈ø≈øe them≈øelves to treat with the Mini≈øters of Princes, to whom they are ≈øent; And the≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours then found what was doubtfull to many before, that the men then in ho≈øtility under the name of Parliament had abu≈øed the world with a pretence of nece≈ø≈øity to take Armes for defence of Religion and lawes, ≈øeeking only power to them≈øelues, and an alteration of Religion and law, and that they had ob≈øtinately refu≈øed all the gracious offers of the King, and his de≈øires of peace, and the≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours were bound in honour and fidelity to deal uprightly in their negotiation, &amp; to declare where the binderances of peace lay; And if the actions of the then pretended Parliament were reproachfull to them≈øelves, they cannot blame the Emba≈ø≈øad ours for a faithfull report of them, &amp; this was very far from making them lyable by the practice of nations to puni≈øhment, or reproof; and it ≈øtood not with the affairs of the then Rebels in England to offer incivility to tho≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours, though they wanted not an inclination to it; &amp; tho≈øe Emba≈ø≈øadours need not be carefull to an≈øwer for ≈øuch an Action, wherein they had cleere rea≈øon, and the warrant of their ≈øuperiours, to whom the complainers di≈øcovered the iniquity of their cau≈øe by ≈øo unju≈øt an exception.</p>
            <p>They come now to the <hi>≈øolemn Emba≈ø≈øy</hi> they ≈øent the States, which (they ≈øay) <hi>was in a time when there was much le≈øs cau≈øe to apply to the States for any need the Parliament had of their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, for that England was wholly in their power, mo≈øt of the Towns &amp; Cities in Ireland, the affairs of Scotland not unpro≈øperous.</hi> But whoever took notice of the affairs then, knew very well they had neede of the forbearance of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces <pb n="10" facs="tcp:123920:6"/>from engaging again≈øt them which had they then acted, its probably they had prevented the progre≈øs of their victories, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them liable to their demerits; And what the men of We≈øtmin≈øter did in that Emba≈ø≈øy was in order to their own affairs, not out of any priciples of affection to the Proty≈øtant Intere≈øt or common good. They endeavoured to draw the United Provinces into their own guilt by the league they propounded, ≈øo as the≈øe Provinces mu≈øt have ≈øupported their u≈øurpation, and have drawn on them the infamy of Murdering the King and all the former Actions, whereby that u≈øurpation was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Though Princes and States for the peace of their people ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enter into leagues for comerce, with ≈øuch, who by wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have obteined the power of States, yet neither Religion nor civill Ju≈øtice permit defence of unju≈øt power; And when tho≈øe Emba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadours di≈øcerned that the United Provinces could not be drawn into a ≈øcandalous league, then they de≈øerted the pro≈øecution; And the≈øe tenders, which their Emba≈ø≈øadours were impowered to make, that would have demon≈øtrated the affection of the≈øe in England to <hi>the good People</hi> of the United Provinces the ≈øame as to them≈øelves, ≈øufficiently demon≈øtrate their affection to the people of the≈øe Provinces to be only for them≈øelves; And the Priviledges they tendred to them were to divide them from their own State to a dependance on a forreign kindne≈øs, and was of the ≈øame ≈øtamp with this hypocriticall profe≈ø≈øion to the good people of the≈øe Provinces, the≈øe good people being in their ≈øen≈øe ≈øuch, as would be ≈øeduced again≈øt their Country by their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, ≈øuch being their dealing with Scots pretending rather private enmity again≈øt ≈øome per≈øons, then Dominion over all, which was ≈øo apparently their De≈øign, as it will be the ≈øhame of any, that ≈øhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after pretend ignorance of it. They ≈øay <hi>the Emba≈ø≈øy was rendred of no effect becau≈øe the Emba≈ø≈øadours were unheartily, and dilatorily dealt with.</hi> But the true rea≈øon was, that the≈øe Ma≈øters had in≈øtructed their Emba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadours to make no agreement without the ab≈øolute ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the≈øe Provinces to them. If their Emba≈ø≈øadours were un≈øafe in their per≈øons, it was not by any neglect of the States of the United Provinces, who placed a ≈øufficient guard about them, &amp; puni≈øhed ≈øuch as offered indignities to them, and if their Emba≈ø≈øadours concealed it, they dealt unfaithfully with their ≈øuperiours, and unju≈øtly with them they were ≈øent to: And when it appeared the States of the United Provinces would not partake in the guilt of that blood, and u≈øurpation with the≈øe Ma≈øters in England, the Emba≈ø≈øadours were recalled home.</p>
